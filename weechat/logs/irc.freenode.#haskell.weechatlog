2019-09-18 23:22:41	iqubic	This doesn't list the laws for a ComonadStore instance: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/comonad-5.0.5/docs/Control-Comonad-Store.html
2019-09-18 23:23:00	iqubic	In fact, it doesn't tell you what any of those functions are supposed to do.
2019-09-18 23:23:26	novum	glguy, do you think the project is doable?

2019-09-18 23:23:49	@glguy	novum: I think it will be quite a big challenge if you aren't already comfortable programming in Haskell
2019-09-18 23:24:02	kky	haskell is <3
2019-09-18 23:26:16	geekosaur	agreed. haskell can certainly do it, whether you know how is another question. and if you're not comfortable with Haskell already you have quite the learning experience upcoming
2019-09-18 23:26:21	novum	glguy; God; whoever, well, thanks for the honest input.

2019-09-18 23:28:09	iqubic	Becoming a Haskell pro is hard.
2019-09-18 23:28:25	novum	where would you start?
2019-09-18 23:28:30	iqubic	I spent 2 hours last night just trying to write a single function.
2019-09-18 23:29:14	iqubic	Granted, I was using comonads, which is hard.
2019-09-18 23:29:26	novum	sounds accurate. I am not daunted---too much, at least.

2019-09-18 23:32:03	EvanR	disclaimer at the bottom of iqubic 's haskell commercial
2019-09-18 23:32:35	iqubic	novum: Stay away from comonads for a long while. You don't need them yet.
2019-09-18 23:33:25	@glguy	No one needs them, but I don't think novum mentioned them
2019-09-18 23:33:36	iqubic	No.
2019-09-18 23:33:48	iqubic	I'm just sharing what I've been working on for the past while.

2019-09-18 23:34:38	nshepperd2	Programming is hard. Haskell is easy. Therefore haskell is not programming.
2019-09-18 23:34:56	iqubic	Not quite!
