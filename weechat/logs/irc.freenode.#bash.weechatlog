2019-09-18 23:28:14	timvisher	Other than that the right answer here is of course to read the stream into an array but like I said at the get go this is a hack because I'm relatively certain that the commands I'm running can't emit whitespace.
2019-09-18 23:28:35	timvisher	Well. Can't have whitespace in the words I care about.

2019-09-18 23:28:50	greybot	https://mywiki.wooledge.org/DontReadLinesWithFor ... "for" is for iterating arguments/arrays, not strings. Never do: for x in $(cat file), or for x in $var; instead, use a glob (*.txt), an array ("${hosts[@]}") or a while-read loop. See also https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf1
2019-09-18 23:30:21	timvisher	SYN_ACK
2019-09-18 23:30:25	kerframil	you don't have to use an array necesarily. you just shouldn't use for.
