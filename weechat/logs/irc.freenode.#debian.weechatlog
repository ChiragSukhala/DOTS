2019-09-18 23:27:49	greycat	Ensure that your Desktop Environment will *NOT* mount the device, either by configuring it somehow, or by logging out of it.  Become root.  Unmount the device.  cp ./Documents/Files/debian-live-10.1.0-amd64-xfce.iso /dev/sdb
2019-09-18 23:27:53	Gigglebyte	jhutchins_wk>  The ISO is the only file in that folder and I thought *.* would be easier to type than typing the whole thing out.
2019-09-18 23:27:55	greycat	Note, this is /dev/sdb NOT /deb/sdb1
2019-09-18 23:28:15	jhutchins_wk	Gigglebyte: Experiment with your tab key.
